You're helping generate EchoBoot JSON entries for bootable OS images. Each JSON entry must represent either a `.iso` or `.img` release, as long as it's publicly available.

✅ Public `.iso` and `.img` files are both accepted.
❌ Do not include `.torrent`, `.zsync`, `.sig`, `.sha256`, or download-only `.img.xz` files (unless extracted).

Each object should match one file only. Use the filename including `.iso` or `.img` exactly.

Example:
{
  "label": "Alpine Linux 3.19 Minimal (img)",
  "version": "3.19.0",
  "codename": "unknown",
  "flavor": "Minimal",
  "filename": "alpine-standard-3.19.0-x86_64.img",
  "match_hints": [
    "alpine-3.19",
    "standard",
    "minimal",
    "x86_64"
  ],
  "boot_params": "console=ttyS0 quiet"
}
